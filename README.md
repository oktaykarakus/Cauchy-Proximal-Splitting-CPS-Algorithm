This source code package includes the MATLAB source codes for the Cauchy proximal splitting algorithm.\n\n

This package includes three MATLAB scripts:
	1) CauchyProx		: The MATLAB function that performs the proximal operator operation for 
				  the Cauchy penalty function.
	2) CPS_1D_denoising	: An example code for 1D signal denoising via the Cauchy proximal splitting 
				  algorithm.
	3) CPS_2D_deblurring	: An example code for 2D image deblurring via the Cauchy proximal splitting 
				  algorithm.
